This two day course will cover the basics of applied statistics.
By the end, you will understand what the standard regression and
ANOVA models are doing, including logistic and Poisson regression and mixed
effects models. You will know how to interpret all of the output, 
and will be able to transfer this knowledge from the
output of one statistical package to another. You will know roughly
when each of these techniques is appropriate, and you will know how
to recognize clear signs that they are inappropriate.

####**Software**
We will use SPSS. It may be helpful to come with a laptop with SPSS
23 or higher installed, but it is not strictly necessary.
